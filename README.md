# **Introduction**

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share my solutions to various coding challenges, primarily from LeetCode. This repository serves as a reflection of my learning journey in data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving skills.

## **Contents**

Each folder contains my solutions to the respective problem. If you would like to test the code please copy the method "{name of problem} + solution" and enter it into the code box on the aforementioned website.

## **Problem Links and Solutions**

Below is a list of problems along with the links to their descriptions and my solutions.
